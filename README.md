This repository contains various collections of code, and programming assignments, that I have written during my studies at Griffith uni.
## Brief Folder Content Descriptions
* **Example MVC**(Javascript, HTML, SQLite, AngularJS, Cordova)
  * Contains an example of a model, a view, and a controller created for the herbal pro app. The code relates to the herbs tab in the app.
* **Assignment 1**(C)
  * The objective of this assignment is to write a simple remote execution system. The remote execution system would allow a user to send 5 different commands to the server, put, get, run, list, and sys. Both the server and the client will be non-blocking and accept multiple quries and connections.
* **Assignment 2**(C)
  * The goal of assignment 2 is to create client and server programs that communticate using shared memory. The server factorises numbers received by the client and returns the factors of those numbers. The system must be able to handle 10 simutanious requests at once. The client must display the progress of each individual outstanding request, as well as the factors calculated by the server.
